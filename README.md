# What to Wear â€” Clothing Recommendation Agent

This application is a smart outfit recommendation assistant built with Streamlit and a code-based agent architecture. It provides personalized clothing suggestions based on real-time weather conditions in a user-specified city.

P.S. You don't have to look out the window anymore :)

## Features

- Fetches hourly weather forecast for the selected city
- Uses an LLM-based agent to reason over weather and user data
- Suggests three stylish outfits: top, bottom, shoes, accessories
- Interactive UI built with Streamlit

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/what_to_wear.git

## Notes

- The app uses Open Meteo API via the `get_weather_forecast` tool to fetch 24-hour weather forecasts.
- Outfit ideas are generated by a Hugging Face-powered LLM agent, orchestrated by `smol-agents`.
